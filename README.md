# Meat Control Console

A simple C# console application created to manage meat registrations using file persistence.

This project was developed as a study exercise focused on fundamental backend concepts such as:
- Object-oriented programming
- File manipulation (TXT)
- Console interaction
- Basic CRUD operations

## Features

- Add meat records
- List all registered meats
- Edit meat information by ID
- Remove meat records
- Automatic ID generation
- Data persistence using a local TXT file

## Data Structure

Each meat record is stored in the following format:

ID;Name;Price

Example:
1;Picanha;89.90
2;Alcatra;59.50

## Technologies

- C#
- .NET Console Application
- File I/O (System.IO)

## Purpose

This project is intentionally simple and does not use databases or web technologies.
The goal is to strengthen core programming concepts before migrating to more advanced architectures.

## Future Improvements

- Input validation
- Refactoring and code organization
- Replace TXT file with JSON
- Migrate persistence to a database
- Convert the application into a Web API
